# Applied-Artificial-Intelligence
This Jupyter Notebook provides an in-depth analysis and comparison of several machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—applied to a dataset. The project outlines the entire data science process including data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, model training with hyperparameter tuning, and comprehensive evaluation of each model's performance. The analysis focuses on optimizing classifier settings to improve predictive accuracy and address class imbalance, featuring detailed discussions on the results and insights drawn from classification reports and confusion matrices. This work serves as a valuable resource for understanding practical machine learning application in classification tasks.
